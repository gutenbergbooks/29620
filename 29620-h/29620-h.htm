<h1><big>SORRY:<br />
Wrong Dimension</big></h1>

<h2>BY ROSS ROCKLYNNE</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p><big><i>So the baby had a pet monster. And so nobody but
baby could see it. And so a couple of men dropped
out of thin air to check and see if the monster
was licensed or not. So what's strange about that?</i></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Baby didn't</span> cry all day, because
he had a monster for a playmate.
But I didn't know he had a
playmate, and much less did I
know it was a monster. The honest
truth is that for the first time
since baby was born, I had my
nerves under control, and I didn't
dare investigate why he wasn't
crying. I got all the ironing done&mdash;all
of it, mind you&mdash;and I got
Harry's work-clothes mended and
I also read three installments of
a Saturday Evening Post serial I'd
been saving. And besides this
Mabel, my neighbor, and I had a
couple or three cups of coffee. We
also had a giggling fit. I remember
once we went off into hysterics at
the picture of ourselves we had&mdash;two
haggard old wrecks of women,
worn out at twenty-three from too
much work around the house.
"But thank Heavens baby hasn't
cried all day!" I gurgled when we
came out of it.</p>

<p>"Neither has mine," said Mabel,
who isn't due for six months.</p>

<p>"Mabel, honest, you kill me,"
I said, "and excuse me while I
comb my messy hair&mdash;because
I'm <i>not</i> a wreck. Harry said so.
He says I'm still the best hunk of
female pulchritude he's met since
high school&mdash;and we've been
married two years!"</p>

<hr />

<p>I went into the bathroom leaving
Mabel choking hysterically
behind me. When I came out of
the bathroom, she was hysterical
but in a different way. She'd discovered
why Harry, Jr., wasn't
crying. She'd been in the nursery.
Her face was white as an egg-shell.</p>

<p>"He's playing with something,"
she chattered. "It's <i>alive</i>. I heard
it cooing back."</p>

<p>I ran three steps to baby's crib
... one on the corner of Little
Jack Horner, one on the sheep of
Little Bo Peep, one on the cupboard
of Old Mother Hubbard.
"Baby!" I almost screamed. But
baby cooed and gurgled and
laughed and rocked back and
forth on his diapers. He was playing
with his teething ring, but
something was trying to jerk the
teething ring out of his hands.
And baby liked it.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.jpg" width="381" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Baby lost his hold on the teething
ring, and fell on his back. The
teething ring stayed up in the air
and then by itself moved toward
baby's waving hands and let him
get a hold of it.</p>

<p>Mabel screeched through her
teeth, "Baby's got it, the monster's
got it, now baby's got it!"
She began to collapse.</p>

<p>"Don't faint," I snapped, "and
don't let's play tennis." I was
shaking. I reached into the crib.
My hands closed around something
that put ice-water in my
vertebrae. It <i>was</i> a monster.</p>

<p>"It's got fur!" I whispered. I
felt some more. "And clammy
scales!" I lifted it out of the crib.
"And a trunk!" I was determined
to save baby. Baby cried!</p>

<hr />

<p>We got some chairs and sat
there for ten minutes close together
while baby played with the
invisible monster. "I don't know
what to do!" I said. "It's alive.
Maybe it's poisonous. But it's
friendly. Maybe it's another baby!"</p>

<p>"From another dimension," said
Mabel.</p>

<p>"Rot," I said; I think I picked
that up from the detective in the
Saturday Evening Post serial.
"Let's keep our heads."</p>

<p>"If baby keeps his," said my
friend Mabel.</p>

<p>That got me. "I've
got to call Harry," I chattered.
"They don't like him to be called
at work, but I've got to call him."</p>

<p>"You'll just worry him," said
Mabel. "Call the police."</p>

<p>"No!" I said. I felt like crying
myself. Baby was so happy. Maybe
the baby monster was happy, too.
The police would do something
awful to it. But what about my
maternal instinct? Something told
me I simply had to save my baby!
"I've <i>got</i> to call Harry," I insisted,
and I went to the 'phone.</p>

<p>The dial tone sounded peculiar,
I remember, but I called Harry's
place of employment. A brisk female
voice cut in:</p>

<p>"What number are you calling,
please?"</p>

<p>"CHarlemont 7-890," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Sorry. You must have the
wrong dimension." There was a
click as she disconnected. I sat
like a statue. A haggard statue
with a greasy housedress on. A
statue that hadn't plucked its eyebrows
in two months. I had a lot of
nerve. I was a bad mother, and a
poor mistress. And I had a swell
husband, who could lie like a
trooper. I wasn't any good, I was
ugly, I was greasy. I cried.
"Mabel," I choked.</p>

<p>It took her a while to get it out
of me, and then her blue eyes
flashed. "I told you!" she cried.
"From another dimension!" In
her broken-down green wedgies
she clattered toward the door. I
heard her fighting it. She couldn't
get it open. Then she tried a window.
It opened, but she couldn't
stick her hand out. She flung herself
around.</p>

<p>"Stella," she said, with a quiver
of that good-looking short upper
lip of hers, "we're trapped in.
We're in the middle of some kind
of fantasy. It's a crazy world we're
living in, Stella. A-bombs and H-bombs
and flying saucers and
space-flight&mdash;it's all the fiction
stuff coming true. Now we're lost
in some other dimension, and I
have to get dinner in the oven."</p>

<p>"Please," I mumbled. "Let's
don't get desperate about the
wrong things." I tried all the
doors and windows in the house,
and it was true. We were trapped
in. There was some barrier surrounding
the house. There wasn't
anything to see outside except a
kind of grey steam.</p>

<p>We went back to check on baby.
He was still playing with the monster.
I bent over the crib and held
a fluffy, fifty-cent toy bear out.
The baby monster took it invisibly
out of my hand. He shoved
it at baby. Baby squealed so
darned happily. And I began to
get some perspective.</p>

<p>"Suspicion is wrong," I told
Mabel. "All the time. That's what
that article we read a couple
months ago in <i>Your World</i> said.
Remember you and I decided
we'd never be suspicious. Maybe
that's the reason we're happy&mdash;if
dirty. We don't suspect anybody
of anything if we can help it&mdash;and
now's no time to start. The
monster is baby's friend."</p>

<hr />

<p>Mabel shuddered. "Okay," she
said. "But I'm still worried about
getting dinner in the oven. Bill's
liable to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hah, now you're being suspicious,"
I said, lousy with virtue.
"Quit worrying. I'm going to call
Harry again." This time I was a
lot calmer. I decided to trust the
universe a little more. I dialed
Harry's number again. A scratchy
male voice answered:</p>

<p>"Sorry, dis dimension is in use.
Would ya please get off da line?"</p>

<p>I dug a few trenches and established
a line of fire.</p>

<p>"Listen," I said. "I'm in trouble."</p>

<p>"A dame," he said wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, a dame," I cried.
"What's so unusual about a
dame? Why does every male in
Kingdom Come get that note in
his voice when he talks with a
dame? Sure I'm a dame, a good-looking
dame! I'd like to punch
you in the eye to prove it!"</p>

<p>He laughed. He must have
turned away from the 'phone.
"It's a dame."</p>

<p>"Okay, find out what she
wants."</p>

<p>"Spill it," he said into the
'phone. I spilled it. "What's that
address again?" he asked. I told
him. "Naw, naw," he said impatiently.
"The planet. The <i>planet</i>.
And the year." I told him.</p>

<p>He must have turned away
from the 'phone again, because I
heard him say off-stage, "They're
only ten years away." I was numb.
He came back on the line. "And
what's dis about a baby monster?
Fur? Scales? A trunk? The size of
Harry, Jr.? Ma'am, we'll be there
in a jiff," and he hung up.</p>

<p>Mabel was nervously hanging
on my ear, but I didn't get a
chance to answer her questions.
The door in the living room
opened and they walked in.</p>

<p>For a second I saw a ship that
looked like a cake-pan, hanging in
the grey steam. Then they closed
the door and grinned at us. Instinctively,
Mabel and I tried to
shrink our bust-lines.</p>

<p>"Hello," said the tall one. He
scratched at his hairy chest and
grinned wider. He was carrying a
piece of machinery that looked
like a camera on a tripod. "Lemme
introduce myself," he said. "Jake
Comstock. We come over to do
you dames a favor. We'll kick you
back where you belong."</p>

<p>"Yeah," I said, "I'll bet."</p>

<p>"And this here is Beany Rocine.
He's my partner. We&mdash;uh&mdash;work
together."</p>

<p>"Hi dere," said Beany. "Where's
da monster?"</p>

<p>"Introductions," said Jake, casting
him a hard look. "Manners."</p>

<p>So I introduced us. "I'm Mrs.
Weaver," I said. "And this is my
neighbor, Mrs. Aspectia."</p>

<p>"Pleased ta meetcha, girls,"
grinned Jake. "You, Blondie," he
was looking at me, "you must be
the one talked on the 'phone. I
liked the way you handled Beany.
Real cute." He dropped the tripod
thing in a corner, and sidled toward
me. "Now where's this monster?"
he asked, slipping his hand
around my bare arm and grinning
down at me.</p>

<hr />

<p>I knew better than to play
rough, so I just looked down at his
hand, and didn't stop looking at it
until he took it away. He lost a
lot of his grin. "So where is it?"
he said, his voice turning hard and
unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that," I
said. "Matter of fact, I'm getting
so the monster doesn't worry me.
He's been playing with baby all
day and baby hasn't objected.
The main thing I'd like you
gentlemen to do for us is to get
busy moving us back to our own
dimension."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Mabel, her
hands on her hips. "And let us
know right now what the charges
are going to be, if any."</p>

<p>"No charge," said the runt
Beany, staring fascinated at her
legs. "'Cept we're taking da monster
wit' us. Real expensive, them
monsters. Drinkos, they're called.
Dey get lost in da dimensions now
and then. Picked one up on Pluto
fifty years or so acome&mdash;or ago."</p>

<p>"Ago?" I said.</p>

<p>"Acome," he corrected.</p>

<p>"Listen," I said, making up my
mind. "You can't have the monster.
He's kept baby happy all
day. But I'll tell you what I'll do.
Tell me what he eats and what to
do for him and I'll keep him. I've
got twenty-five dollars in poker
winnings you can have. Okay&mdash;Jake?"</p>

<p>Jake broke out laughing. "You
kids are terrific," he said. "You
don't know what the score is.
You're cute!"</p>

<p>"Thanks," I said bitterly. "You
restore my confidence. I feel myself
blooming under your hungry
gaze."</p>

<p>"Those Drinkos are worth a
couple million credits, is what I'm
getting at, and you offer us a
stinkin' twenty-five dollars. Tell
you what, Blondie." He winked
at me. "You kids are over-worked.
One look and you can tell that.
Well, Beany and me have got a
little cabin up on Dimension-L,
cut off from everything. The four
of us can go there and have a fine
old time. We could stay there a
month, and still get you back
here in time to kiss your husbands
when they get in from work.
Whaddya say, Blondie? And you
can keep the Drinko!"</p>

<p>"We are accepting no propositions
this week," said Mabel with
dignity.</p>

<p>"Ah-h, a coupla kill-joys,"
growled Beany, wandering off toward
the hall.</p>

<p>Mabel looked at me and then
picked up a vase off the mantle
over the fire-place. I gave her the
nod. "Stay away from that
Drinko," she warned Beany, "or
I'll let you have it."</p>

<p>Beany was annoyed. He stopped,
looking imploringly at Jake. Jake
giggled as if the whole thing
tickled his sense of humor, and
walked cat-footed toward Mabel.
She let go the vase with a right-handed
swing. He had his right
arm out stiff in front of him,
though, and the vase shied off and
smashed against the television set.
Then he grabbed Mabel in a bear hug.</p>

<p>That set me off. I had a yearning
for Harry, then. He would
have laid these mugs out. And
that's all they were&mdash;mugs, cheap
crooks. I hopped on one leg, yanking
off one of my oxfords. I
brought the heel down on Jake's
curly head. But it didn't do a
thing for him, except make him
mad. He brought his arm back,
cursing at me. It caught me on my
lipstick. I remember being surprised
that he was actually knocking
me out. But that's what he
did.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I woke up, the first thing
I knew was that Harry, Jr., was
screaming. I groggily stood up,
and stepped over Mabel, who was
just beginning to moan. I went to
the nursery and grabbed up my
baby. "Don't cry," I begged him.
"Don't be mad. I'll get your
Drinko back. Those dirty thieves,
I'll get it back." I held him under
one arm, his pants dripping. I
think I looked like a Pekinese,
with my hair over my eyes. I went
to the 'phone, dialed Harry's number,
and got the same routine.</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> have the wrong dimension,"
I cried before the operator
could hang up. "This is an emergency.
A couple of crooks stole my
Drinko. Please get me the dimension-police."</p>

<p>"You have a Drinko?" the operator
asked cautiously. "There
must be some mistake. You are
calling from Earth? From 1954? I
am sorry. Congress ruled Earth
1954 could not be connected with
the dimension-system. It would be
impossible for you to own a
Drinko."</p>

<p>"Some crooks from 1964 stole
my Drinko!" I insisted.</p>

<p>"One moment, please. The Supervisor
informs me this is an unauthorized
call. It will be necessary
to conduct a police investigation."
There were clickings, there were
buzzings, there were groups of
fuzzy, far-off voices, and finally
the police came in.</p>

<p>"A couple of crooks stole my
baby's Drinko!" I repeated loudly.
"I demand my rights as a dimension-citizen!"</p>

<p>"Two thieves confiscated your
Drinko," a dry voice said. "Very
well. Describe them, please. Describe
characteristic phrases, expressions,
and voice-intonations
also." I described them. "Very
good. Did you say Earth 1954?
Excellent. Only a matter of six
dimensions and thirty years. We
shall investigate immediately."
He hung up.</p>

<p>"Hi, Stella," said Mabel, up on
one elbow and looking fuzzily at
me. "You think I'll get out of this
in time to get Bill's dinner in the
oven? Bill's so darned touchy
about dinner."</p>

<p>"Teach him a lesson, then," I
snapped, disgusted with her, and
running to the door, because somebody
was knocking there. "Train
him. Disappoint him. Break his
pattern. Don't have dinner. Good
evening, gentlemen," I said as I
opened the door. The police came
in. They had Beany. They had
Jake.</p>

<hr />

<p>There were three police. The
one in front, a young, nice-looking
one, touched his cap and smiled
quietly. "Here's your Drinko,
ma'am," he said, but I already
knew the Drinko was back. Harry,
Jr., stopped crying. He gurgled
happily. Somehow, I was willing
to bet, he could see the Drinko. I
put him on the floor and the policeman
put the Drinko on the
floor. It was beautiful, those
squeals that came from my baby.
The young policeman smiled again,
a quiet, tanned smile.</p>

<p>"We want to thank you, ma'am.
These two are the worst criminals
in the dimension-system. I want
you to know you may have the
Drinko as a reward for your part
in apprehending them. Also, I
wish to say that I admire you for
your trippo in pretending to be a
dimension-citizen, when, of course,
you are not."</p>

<p>"Trippo?"</p>

<p>"Spunk, if you prefer."</p>

<p>"Well, I had to get my baby's
Drinko back," I said.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he smiled.
"Drinkos make wonderful pets.
The day may come when Earth
1954 will be connected with dimension-system&mdash;and
then more
Drinkos will be available."</p>

<p>"Can't we," I asked, "just stay
alone in our quiet nook of space?"</p>

<p>"My thought, too," said Mabel,
getting to her feet at last and
throwing her hair back. "And is
there any chance of getting out of
here? It's exciting, thrilling, and
romantic, but Bill still has to eat."</p>

<p>"Immediately, Madam! It is
merely a matter of disengaging
the chrono-beam, which happened
to become tangled, in space-time,
with the gravitonic structure of
the neutronic chrono-field."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mabel. "That explains
it! And so clearly!"</p>

<p>They set up an instrument that
looked like the one Jake and Beany
had. They sighted along the diagonals
of the room and pressed buttons.
Then they opened the door.
"In two minutes, ma'am," the
smiling cop said. "Good day. It is
my hope that we shall meet
again." They disappeared out the
door. Sure enough, there was a
cake-pan ship hanging in the grey
steam. They piled into it and the
ship moved off, wobbling, until I
couldn't see it any more.</p>

<p>A minute later, the grey steam
melted away and so did Mabel.</p>

<p>Harry came home on schedule.
"Baby has hardly cried all day!"
I told him happily. "What a relief!
I got a lot of your old clothes
mended and I read three installments
of the Saturday Evening
Post serial."</p>

<p>"Fine!" said Harry, looking
around. "What else happened?"</p>

<p>"Not much," I said, deciding to
break it to him gradually. "Except
we've got a Drinko." I took him
into the nursery. Baby was sound
asleep. I supposed the Drinko was,
too. "There he is," I said, pointing
to the depression at the foot of
the crib. "That's the Drinko." I
told Harry the whole story. He
listened with a straight face.</p>

<p>"Well!" he said. "What thrilling
adventures you have. Tell me,
isn't this sort of thing sometimes
too exciting?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said, deciding to
feed his stomach before I really
tried to convince him. "It all
comes under the heading of the
drab, routine duties of a housewife.
Come on now, dinner's
ready."</p>
